# TowerDefenseGame

## THE CANNON MUST BE DRAGGED FROM THE BUTTON!!!

A simple tower defense game made with Godot.
Note: there is no win screen right now and the cannon targeting is slightly broken still.

Each time this game is loaded, a unique, randomly generated path is created. The player starts with enough money to initially place 1 cannon which can attack the enemy ufos. As the ufos are killed, the player gains money allowing them to place more cannons.
